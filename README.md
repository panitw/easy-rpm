usy-rpm

> Easily create RPM package to install files/directories

## Prerequisite
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1` and can only run in RedHat varient linux distribution. The `rpmdevtools` and `rpmlint` package needed to be install beforehand.

```shell
[root@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install rpmdevtools rpmlint
```

## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-easy-rpm --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-easy-rpm');
```

## The "easy_rpm" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `easy_rpm` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  easy_rpm: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage
In this example, the default options are used for most of the fields. Each file are copied indivitually. The directory structure will be preserved.
**It is important that 'files' group has to resides in a target**. The example below is the target named 'release'

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  easy_rpm: {
    options: {
      name: "mypackage",
      version: "1.0.0",
      release: "1",
      buildArch: "x86_64"
    },
    release: {
      files: [
        {src: "output/file1.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/output/file1.js
        {src: "output/file2.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/output/file2.js
        {src: "output/file3.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/output/file3.js
      ]
    },
  },
})
```

#### Using CWD attribute (current working director)
In this example, Each file are copied indivitually. The "cwd" attribute is used to pick up the file in the "cwd", the directory structure `under` "cwd" is preserved

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  easy_rpm: {
    options: {
      name: "mypackage",
      version: "1.0.0",
      release: "1",
      buildArch: "x86_64"
    },
    release: {
      files: [
        {cwd: "output", src: "output/file1.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/file1.js
        {cwd: "output", src: "output/sub1/file2.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/sub1/file2.js
        {cwd: "output", src: "output/sub2/file3.js", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = /target/dir/sub2/file3.js
      ]
    },
  },
})
```
#### Dynamically generate the file list using wildcard
In this example, the file list will be generated automatically. Files that the path match the wildcard will be included.
The file list is generated using node-glob so please find more info about the wildcard pattern at [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  easy_rpm: {
    options: {
      name: "mypackage",
      version: "1.0.0",
      release: "1",
      buildArch: "x86_64"
    },
    release: {
      files: [
        {src: "output/**", dest: "/target/dir"}, //Target = All files & directory structure under /output folders
      ]
    },
  },
})
```

#### Setting mode/owner/group of the target files
In this example, the mode/owner/group of each target file can be set using mode/owner/group attribute of each file element

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  easy_rpm: {
    options: {
      name: "mypackage",
      version: "1.0.0",
      release: "1",
      buildArch: "x86_64"
    },
    release: {
      files: [
        {src: "output/file1.js", dest: "/target/dir", mode: "755"},
        {src: "output/file2.js", dest: "/target/dir", mode: "o+x", owner: "mysql"},
        {src: "output/file3.js", dest: "/target/dir", owner: "admin", group: "admin"},
        {src: "output2/**", dest: "/target/dir", mode: "644"}, //Works with wildcard as well
      ]
    },
  },
})
```
